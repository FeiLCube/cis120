============
=: Task 2 :=
============

- Do you plan on creating any new classes in your design? If so, what classes
  are you making, what do they store, and what behaviors do they have?
  The only new class I have created is Channel, which is supposed to represent the behavior of
  a channel in the server. So far, I have only defined the private fields name, users, 
  nicknamesOfUsers, and ownerId. I have also created getter functions to help with implementing
  the functions required of this task. I have getter functions, but that's about it for this
  class.
  
- How do you plan on storing what users are registered on the server?
  I stored user IDs in a Map, because each user has a User ID and a nickname, which should
  be mapped to each other.

- How do you plan on keeping track of which user has which user ID, considering
  the fact that the user's nickname can change over the course of the program?
  The user ID is the key in the TreeMap clientData, so while the value (nickname) may be changed, 
  the key (user ID) to which that value is mapped to should not change.

- How do you plan on storing what users are in a channel?
  In my class Channel, I stored the users in a Map.

- How do you plan on keeping track of which user is the owner of each channel?
  In my class Channel, I have a field that is called the ownerID, which is an integer.

- Justify your choice of collections (Set, Map, or List) for the
  collections you use in your design.
  I have user IDs in a Map, because each user has a User ID and a nickname, which should
  be mapped to each other. The user ID is the key in the TreeMap clientData, so while the value (nickname) may be changed, 
  the key (user ID) to which that value is mapped to should not change. The users field in my
  Channel class stores users in a Map for the same reason.


============
=: Task 3 :=
============

- Did you make any changes to your design while doing this task? Why?
  I changed the design of channels in the ServerModel class to a Set instead of a Map. This
  is because iterating through the map took much more work than iterating through a single set.


============
=: Task 4 :=
============

- Did you make any changes to your design while doing this task? Why?
	None.

============
=: Task 5 :=
============

- How do you plan on keeping track of which channels are invite-only?
	A boolean field called inviteOnly.

- Will you make any changes to your work from before in order to make
  implementing invite-only channels easier?
	Nope.

============
=: Task 6 :=
============

- Did you have to make any changes to your design in Task 6? Why?
	None.
- If you were to redo this assignment, what changes (if any) would you make in
  how you designed your code?
  	None.
