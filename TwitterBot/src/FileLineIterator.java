 * reading a line whenever the next() method is called. See
 * Java's documentation for BufferedReader to learn how to construct one given
 * a path to a file. Then, think about how you can use BufferedReader's
 * methods within this class to implement our desired functionality.
 * 
 * Note: Any IOExceptions thrown by readers should be caught and handled properly.
